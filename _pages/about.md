My name is 𝓜𝓭. 𝓕𝓪𝓱𝓲𝓶 𝓢𝓱𝓪𝓴𝓲𝓵 𝓒𝓱𝓸𝔀𝓭𝓱𝓾𝓻𝔂, and I am a 𝒅𝒆𝒅𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒎𝒎𝒆𝒓, 𝒅𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒓, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒔𝒆𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒓 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒂 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒐𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒊𝒏 𝒃𝒐𝒕𝒉 𝒅𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒑𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒆𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, where I have built a solid foundation in programming, system architecture, and cybersecurity practices.


 I have worked on various projects across different domains. I developed 𝒕𝒘𝒐 2𝑫 𝒈𝒂𝒎𝒆𝒔 𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑪++ 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝑮𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉𝒙: 𝑻𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒖𝒓𝒆 𝑯𝒖𝒏𝒕, 𝒂𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒂𝒅𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑾𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒐𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑫𝒂𝒓𝒌 𝑺𝒉𝒂𝒅𝒐𝒘, a dark fantasy action game inspired by Demon Slayer. These projects reflect my interest in game development and my ability to create immersive experiences using graphical libraries. 


I also developed a 𝒎𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊𝒇𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍 𝑯𝒐𝒔𝒑𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝑴𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒈𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑺𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎 𝒎𝒐𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒆 𝒂𝒑𝒑 designed to streamline healthcare operations with features like patient management and appointment scheduling. In addition, I have 𝒃𝒖𝒊𝒍𝒕 𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓 𝒇𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒘𝒆𝒃𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒆𝒔, including 𝒕𝒘𝒐 𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 𝒐𝒇 𝒎𝒚 𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍 𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒇𝒐𝒍𝒊𝒐 (one using Google Sites, another with JavaScript), and a 𝑫𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒎 𝑪𝒂𝒓 𝑫𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒉𝒊𝒑 𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒆 𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑨𝑺𝑷.𝑵𝑬𝑻 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑪#. I also created a 𝑺𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒇𝒊𝒄 𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒄𝒖𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒐𝒓 𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑱𝒂𝒗𝒂, further showcasing my problem-solving abilities and programming skills. 


As a bug bounty hunter, I have 𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓 15 𝑯𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒐𝒇 𝑭𝒂𝒎𝒆 entries for discovering vulnerabilities on various platforms, including private company programs. My work has allowed me to apply my expertise in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment in real-world scenarios.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
2. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
3. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
4. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
5. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
6. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
